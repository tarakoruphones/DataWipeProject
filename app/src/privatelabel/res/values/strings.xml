        important and that your personal information must be protected. This
        privacy policy describes the information that we collect from you, how we

    </p>
    <p>
        Please read through this policy carefully and periodically. Please contact
        us at support@pervacioo.com if you have any questions about the contents of
        this policy.

        <strong>
            The information we collect is necessary for providing our services.

        We do not collect any information from or about you that does not have to

        Under no circumstances do we collect and store personal information from or

        another person, such as your first and last name, physical addresses, email
        addresses, telephone numbers, fax numbers, or any information that is
        specific to you that is stored within your device. Our data transfer
        feature only stores data from your old device onto the new device that you
        are transferring the information over to. Throughout the entire process,
        the MobileCopy server is not accessed so that we do not see your personal
        information. In other words, you can be assured that there is no way for us
        to collect your information if you use our application to copy the data
        from one phone to another.

        association with any specific individual. Examples of non-personal
        information are: device ID, phone IMEI number, phone model, rom, phone
        operator, location, operation system, transfer logs, etc.
